                <p> As you can see based on the contents of this website, it is evident I like building things.
                As a child, I was always intrigued by the idea of how people are able to build physical intricut
                objects. I had no understanding of this as a child but my brain would never left me forget it thoughout my life. As years
                passed by, I continue to learn and grasp an understanding on how engines, electrical motors, and even control systems work
                but i still never understood the absolute core to all this engineering and making objects these come to life, Code.
